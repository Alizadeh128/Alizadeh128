<p align="left">Currently, I am focusing on honing my skills in back-end programming.<br>Apart from coding, I have a keen interest in AI and its applications in solving complex problems.<br>I am an advocate for open source software and actively contribute to various projects. I believe in the power of collaboration and the positive impact it can have on the software development community. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences through writing technical blog posts and tutorials to help others on their coding journey.</p>
